# ACX Master
ACX Master is a simple mastering tool designed to master and encode the final MP3 which an ACX audiobook narrator will upload to ACX in order to pass the ACX submission requirements with the least amount of headache possible.

Features:  
- Adjustable targets for integrated loudness, loudness range, and true peak.
- 18-band graphic equalizer.
- Optional effects for noise suppression, declick, noise gate, as well as the ability to output stereo files if desired.
- Can select one file at a time, or select multiple files at once for a batch process.
- Conformed audio is first checked against ACX standards for RMS, true peak, noise floor, and duration, and prompts you with any warnings which may still persist before being written to a file.
- All of your settings can be saved to a configuration file which will be loaded at each program start.

**Download the precompiled executables for your target operating system to get started (only 64-bit platforms currently supported):**
