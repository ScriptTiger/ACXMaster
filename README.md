# ACX Master
ACX Master is a simple stand-alone ACX checker and mastering tool which can work on either single files or on multiple in a batch process. When in Check Mode, the tool is designed to check audio files against the ACX submission requirements and alert you to any conflicts. When in Master mode, the tool is designed to master and encode the final MP3 files as transparently and with the least amount of headache possible which an ACX audiobook narrator will then upload to ACX in order to pass the ACX submission requirements. However, even if you're not submitting to ACX, but just appreciate the gold standard which ACX submission requirements set for vocal dialog, such as for alternative audiobook publishers, general voice acting and narrations, voice-overs, video essays, talking head videos, podcasts, and more, ACX Master can also export to either 16 or 24-bit ALAC/M4A, FLAC, or PCM/WAV lossless audio formats to allow you to achieve the ACX gold standard no matter what your intended use is.

Features:  
- Can switch between Check mode and Master mode, to allow you to use the tool as either a stand-alone ACX checker or as a mastering tool.
- Adjustable targets for integrated loudness, loudness range, and true peak, which are achieved as transparently as possible.
- 18-band graphic equalizer.
- Optional effects to suppress noise, de-click, noise gate, generate noise (if your noise floor is too low), as well as the ability to output stereo files if desired.
- Can select one file at a time, or select multiple files at once for a batch process.
- Conformed audio can first be optionally checked to prompt you with any warnings which may still persist before being written to a file. However, if you feel confident your presets are acceptable, you can choose to disable this check to speed up the process.
- When checking audio against ACX submission requirements, properties checked are RMS, true peak, noise floor, duration, channel layout, sample rate, bit rate, and codec.
- Can export to an MP3 which meets ACX submission requirements, or can optionally export to 16 or 24-bit ALAC/M4A, FLAC, or PCM/WAV lossless audio formats.
- All of your settings can be saved to a configuration file which will be loaded at each program start.
